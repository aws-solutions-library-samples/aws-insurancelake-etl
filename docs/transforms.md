## Using Transforms

- Transform configuration is specified in the `transform-spec` section of the workflow's JSON configuration file. The filename follows the convention of `<database name>-<table name>.json` and is stored in the `/etl/transformation-spec` folder in the `etl-scripts` bucket. When using CDK for deployment, the contents of the `/lib/glue_scripts/lib/transformation-spec` directory will be automatically deployed to this location.

- For an example of all transforms in one place, refer to the [all-transforms-example.json](../lib/glue_scripts/transformation-spec/all-transforms-example.json) in the `transformation-spec` directory of the repository.

- The order that you enter the transforms into the JSON file is important, and should be chosen deliberately. Each transform is executed in the order they are defined on the incoming dataset starting from the beginning of the transform_spec section of the file.

- If a transform name is specified in the configuration that is undefined (no transform function exists), the workflow **will not fail**. Instead you will see a warning message in the logs (below). The remaining transforms will be executed; this behavior is designed to make iterative development easier.

    ```log
    Transform function transform_futuretransform called for in SyntheticGeneralData-PolicyData.json not implemented
    ```

- Except where noted, transforms will overwrite an existing field if specified as the result field. Where available use the `source` parameter to indicate that a different column should be used as the source data, and the column specified in the `field` parameter should be used for the result value. Specifying a source field to create a new column for transforms is useful for debugging issues with a transform, preserving original data, or having a backup datapoint available when incoming data formats are less clear.

## Using Transforms More Than Once

Transform types can be specified more than once in the transform specification by using an optional unique suffix, in the form of `:` following by a string. The string can be any number or identifier that is meaningful to the data pipeline designer. The suffix does not determine the order of exection; the transforms are executed in the order they are defined in the transform specification.

- **Important Note:** InsuranceLake-provided transforms are optimized to run in a single group using Spark's `withColumns` and `select` DataFrame methods. Specifying multiple transform types will limit this optimization and should only be used when strictly necessary for the workflow. Read more about optimizing workflow performance when running a large number of transforms in [The hidden cost of Spark withColumn](https://medium.com/@manuzhang/the-hidden-cost-of-spark-withcolumn-8ffea517c015).

```json
    "transform_spec": {
        "lookup:1": [
            {
                "field": "CoverageCode",
                "source": "CoverageName",
                "lookup": "CoverageCode"
            }
        ],
        "combinecolumns": [
            {
				"field": "Program",
				"format": "{}-{}",
				"source_columns": [ "CoverageCode", "PolicyYear" ]
            }
        ],
        "lookup:2": [
            {
                "field": "ProgramCode",
                "source": "Program",
                "lookup": "ProgramCode"
            }
        ]
    }
```

## Behavior When There is No Transformation Specification

When there is no transformation specification file or an empty transformation specification in the etl-scripts bucket for the workflow, **the ETL will perform no transformations**. However, the ETL will save a *recommended* transformation specification file to the Glue Temp bucket,  `<environment>-insurancelake-<account>-<region>-glue-temp` bucket, in the folder `/etl/collect_to_cleanse` following the naming convention `<database>-<table>.json`.

When this behavior occurs, you will see the following log message in the Glue Job Output Logs:
```log
No transformation specification found, generating recommended spec to: s3://...
```

This recommended transformation specification file can be used as a starting point to build your own transformations.  Currently the recommended transformation specification supports the following:
* `decimal` transforms for any fields that Spark identifies as `float` or `double`
* `date` transforms for any fields that contain the text `date` in the field names
* `timestamp` transforms for any fields that contain the text `time` in the field names
* `input_spec` section for Excel files identified by their extension with default values

## Formatting

### currency
Convert specified numeric field with currency formatting to Decimal (fixed precision)

|Parameter    |Type    |Description
|---	|---	|---
|field    |required    |Name of (destination) field to hold the resulting decimal conversion, and source field if source not specified separately
|format    |optional    |Decimal precision and scale (separated by comma), defaults to 16,2
|source    |optional    |Name of source field, defaults to destination field
|euro    |optional    |If `true`, handle European (5.000.000,12 or 5 000 000,12) currency format, otherwise handle 5,000,000.12; defaults to `false`

- While this transform will work on numeric fields, we recommend `changetype` to convert to decimal values because it is more efficient when combined with other data type changes.
- This conversion essentially extracts any valid number from a string value; it removes any character that is not in `[0-9,-.]`.

```json
"currency": [
    {
        "field": "SmallDollars",
        "format": "6,2"
    },
    {
        "field": "EuroValue",
        "source": "EuroValueFormatted",
        "euro": true
    }
]
```

### changetype
Convert specified fields to decimal (fixed precision), int, bigint, string, etc.

|Parameter    |Type    |Description
|---	|---	|---
|key    |required    |Name of the field to convert
|value  |required    |Destination data type expresseed using the [Spark simpleString](https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.3.0/api/python/_modules/pyspark/sql/types.html) syntax

- Transform spec is a single JSON object containing a list of string value pairs for each field to convert

- Transform can be used to rename a nested field in place by redefining the struct data type, with new field names using Spark's simpleString syntax for struct types, for example: `struct<name:type,name2:array<int>>`. See [all-transforms-example.json](../lib/glue_scripts/transformation-spec/all-transforms-example.json#L114) for a more complex example.

```json
"changetype": {
    "ExpiringPremiumAmount": "decimal(10,2)",
    "WrittenPremiumAmount": "decimal(10,2)",
    "EarnedPremium": "decimal(10,2)",
    "PrimaryKeyId": "bigint",
    "GrowingCount": "bigint",
    "PolicyKey": "string",
    "notes_struct": "json"
}
```

### date
Convert specified date fields to ISO format based on known input format

|Parameter    |Type    |Description
|---	|---	|---
|field    |required    |Name of (destination) field to hold the resulting date conversion, and source field if source not specified separately
|format    |required    |Date format specified using [Spark datetime patterns](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-ref-datetime-pattern.html)
|source    |optional    |Name of source field, defaults to destination field

- With Spark datetime patterns, `M` (uppercase) means **month** and `m` (lowercase) means **minutes**. Mixing these up will result  in date parse errors.

- Use `dd` to indicate exactly two digit dates, and `d` to indicate **either one or two** digits dates. This applies to all other symbols in the datetime pattern. Single character symbols are the most flexible.

- An error similar to the following typically means that some or all of your dates are not formatted in the way the date pattern expects. Consider using [data quality rules](./data_quality.md#Configuration) to test your data.
    ```log
    You may get a different result due to the upgrading of Spark 3.0
    Fail to parse 'YYYY-M-d' in the new parser. You can set spark.sql.legacy.timeParserPolicy to LEGACY to restore the behavior before Spark 3.0, or set to CORRECTED and treat it as an invalid datetime string.
    ```

```json
"date": [
    {
        "field": "StartDate",
        "format": "M/d/yy"
    },
    {
        "field": "EndDate",
        "format": "yy-MM-dd"
    },
    {
        "field": "valuationdate",
        "source": "valuationdatestring",
        "format": "yyyyMMdd"
    }
]
```

### implieddecimal

|format    |required    |Decimal precision and scale (separated by comma)
|source    |optional    |Name of source field, defaults to destination field
|num_implied    |optional   |Number of implied decimal digits in the source field, defaults to `2`

- Use this transform to interpret decimal precision data stored in integer format, common in mainframe or flat file data formats.

```json
"implieddecimal": [
    {
        "field": "indemnity_paid_current_period",
        "num_implied": "4",
        "format": "16,4"
    },
    {
        "field": "claim_amount",
        "source": "claim_amount_string",
        "format": "16,2"
    }
]
```

### timestamp

    {
        "field": "GenerationDate",
        "format": "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS+0000"
    },
    {
        "field": "DataLoadTimestamp",
        "source": "DataLoadString",
        "format": "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSSZ"
    }
]
```

### titlecase
Convert specified string field to title or proper case (for example, "my name" will become "My Name")

|Parameter    |Type    |Description
|---	|---	|---
|field    |required    |Name of field to convert in place to title case

- Transform spec is a simple list of fields of type string to convert

        "field": "SplitPremium",
        "source_columns": [ "WrittenPremiumAmount", "SplitPercent1", "SplitPercent2" ],
        "empty_value": 0
    }
]
```

### earnedpremium
Calculate monthly earned premium

|Parameter    |Type    |Description
|---	|---	|---
|field    |required    |Name of (destination) field to hold the calculated earned premium result; can be the same field as one of the `written_premium_list` columns, which will overwrite the original value with the result
|written_premium_list    |required    |List of numeric source column names containing written premium amounts specified as a JSON array (at least 1 is required)
|policy_effective_date   |required   |Indicates the existing date column to use for determining the start of the policy. When `byday` is `true`, this date will be used to pro-rate the earned premium for the first month of the policy; when `byday` is `false`, it will be used to identify the number of active policy months (always a whole number).
|policy_expiration_date  |required   |Indicates the existing date column to use for determining the end of the policy. When `byday` is `true`, this date will be used to pro-rate the earned premium for the first month of the policy; when `byday` is `false`, it will be used to identify the number of active policy months (always a whole number).
|period_start_date  |required   |Indicates the existing date column to use for determining the start of the earned premium calculation period for each row of data; usually this is the first day of the month and is created by the [expandpolicymonths](#expandpolicymonths) transform
|period_end_date    |required   |Indicates the existing date column to use for determining the end of the earned premium calculation period for each row of data; usually this is the last day of the month and is created by the [expandpolicymonths](#expandpolicymonths) transform
|byday    |optional   |Used to specify the calculation method: if `true`, earned premium will be proportional to the number of days in the reporting period; if `false`, earned premium will be divided evenly across all active policy months, defaults to `false`

- If you are overwriting an existing field and calculating the earned premium multiple times (for example, different methods), be aware that the operations will be processed in sequence and impact subsequent operations. In other words, the value that overwrites the field in the first operation will be used in the second operation and so on. If you need to calculate earned premium multiple times using the same inputs, you should use a new field for the result.

- If any of the date inputs have null values, the earned premium will be null. Empty or null written premium values are treated as 0.

```json
"earnedpremium": [
    {
        "field": "CalcEarnedPremium",
        "written_premium_list": [
                "WrittenPremiumAmount"

|---	|---	|---
|policy_effective_date   |required   |Indicates the existing date column to use for determining the start of the policy. When `byday` is `true`, this date will be used to pro-rate the earned premium for the first month of the policy; when `byday` is `false`, it will be used to identify the number of active policy months (always a whole number).
|policy_expiration_date  |required   |Indicates the existing date column to use for determining the end of the policy. When `byday` is `true`, this date will be used to pro-rate the earned premium for the first month of the policy; when `byday` is `false`, it will be used to identify the number of active policy months (always a whole number).
|policy_month_start_field  |required   |Indicates the name of the field to add to the dataset containing the first day of the month for the expanded row of data
|policy_month_end_field    |required   |Indicates the name of the field to add to the dataset containing the last day of the month for the expanded row of data
|policy_month_index |required   |Indicates the name of field to add to the dataset containing the expanded policy month index
|uniqueid   |optional   |Use to specify a field name to add with a generated GUID, unique to each policy

- Use this transform to convert a list of insurance policies (one row per policy) to a list of active policy months (one row per month per policy). This transform will change the shape/size of the input data; specifically, it will increase the number of rows to `number of policies x number of policy months`.
- This transform will add colums to each row containing the first day of the month, the last day of the month, and the policy month number/index.
- The index column is required so that it is always possible to recover the original number of rows using a simple WHERE statement (in other words, `WHERE PolicyMonthIndex = 1`).
- If either `policy_effective_date` or `policy_expiration_date` field values are null, the policy row will not be expanded to any additional rows and will have null values for the policy month and index fields.
- Index column values are 1-based, matching the array reference standard in Athena SQL.

```json
"expandpolicymonths": {
    "policy_effective_date": "EffectiveDate",
    "policy_expiration_date": "ExpirationDate",
    "uniqueid": "generated_policy_number",
    "policy_month_start_field": "StartDate",
    "policy_month_end_field": "EndDate",
    "policy_month_index": "PolicyMonthIndex"
}
```

### policymonths
Calculate number of months between policy start and end dates

|Parameter    |Type    |Description
|---	|---	|---
|field    |required    |Name of (destination) field to hold the calculated number of months; can be an existing field, which will overwrite the original value with the result
|policy_effective_date |required   |Indicates the existing date column to use for determining the start of the policy
|policy_expiration_date |required   |Indicates the existing date column to use for determining the end of the policy
|normalized |optional   |If `true` the calculated number of months will always be a whole number (uses Python's [rrule dateutil function](https://dateutil.readthedocs.io/en/stable/rrule.html) to perform a calendar walk); if `false` the calculated number of months will be a fractional number based on the exact number of days between the effective and expiration dates; defaults to `false`

```json
"policymonths": [
    {
        "field": "CalcNumMonths",
        "policy_effective_date": "EffectiveDate",
        "policy_expiration_date": "ExpirationDate",
        "normalized": true
    }
]
```

## Structured Data

### jsonexpandarray
Converts an ArrayType column (typically created from loading JSON nested data) to 1 row per array element with index

|Parameter    |Type    |Description    |
|---	|---	|---	|
|field  |required   |Name of (destination) field to hold expanded array elements, and source ArrayType field if source is not specified separately    |
|source |optional   |Source ArrayType field; defaults to destination field
|index_field    |required   |Name of field to hold the expanded array element index

- This transform uses Spark's [posexplode_outer](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/pyspark.sql/api/pyspark.sql.functions.posexplode_outer.html) function, so empty or null array values will remain in the dataset as a single row with null in the destination field
- Index column values are 1-based, matching the array reference standard in Athena SQL
- The index column is required so that there is always an easy way to get back to the data before being expanded (in other words, `where index == 1`)

```json
"jsonexpandarray": [
    {
        "field": "policyaddress",
        "source": "policyaddresses",
        "index_field": "policyaddress_index"
    }
]
```

### jsonexpandmap
Converts a MapType or StructType column (typically created from loading JSON nested data) to 1 row per map key, value pair with index column

|Parameter    |Type    |Description    |
|---	|---	|---	|
|field  |required   |Name of (destination) field to hold expanded map values, and source MapType or StructType field if source is not specified separately    |
|source |optional   |Source MapType or StructType field; defaults to destination field
|index_field    |required   |Name of field to hold the expanded map key, value pair index
|key_field  |required   |Name of field to hold the expanded map key name

- This transform uses Spark's [posexplode_outer](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/pyspark.sql/api/pyspark.sql.functions.posexplode_outer.html) function, so empty or null map values will remain in the dataset as a single row with null in the destination field
- Index column values are 1-based, matching the array reference standard in Athena SQL
- The index column is required so that there is always an easy way to get back to the data before being expanded (in other words, `where index == 1`)

```json
"jsonexpandmap": [
    {
        "field": "activities",
        "index_field": "activity_index",
        "key_field": "activity_id"

    }
]
```

## Miscellaneous Data Operations

### lookup
Replace or add specified column values with values looked up from an DynamoDB table using a single value lookup key

|Parameter    |Type    |Description    |
|---	|---	|---	|
|field  |required   |Name of (destination) field to hold looked up values, and source field if source is not specified separately    |
|source |optional   |Source field with values matching the lookup data; defaults to destination field
|lookup    |required   |Name of lookup set of data which is used to match the `column_name` attribute in the DynamoDB table
|nomatch  |optional   |Value to use for lookups that have no match; defaults to null. **Must be the same data type as the looked up data.**
|source_system  |optional   |Value to use for the `source_system` attribute in the DynamoDB table; defaults to the database name or ([first level folder structure name in the Collect bucket](loading_data.md#bucket-layout)). Use this override parameter to share lookups across different databases.

```json
"lookup": [
    {
        "field": "smokingclass",
        "lookup": "smokingclass"
    },
    {
        "field": "issuestatename",
        "source": "issuestate",
        "lookup": "StateCd",
        "nomatch": "N/A",
        "source_system": "global"
    }
]
```

- If your lookup data exceeds the [DynamoDB item size limit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/ServiceQuotas.html#limits-items), consider using the [multilookup](#multilookup) transform instead, which will split the lookup data into multiple items.

- The provided `resources/load_dynamodb_lookup_table.py` script can be used to load prepared JSON data into the DynamoDB table:

    - Script parameters:
        |Parameter  |Type   |Description    |
        |---    |---    |---    |
        |source_system  |required   |String value that should match the source system name ([first level folder structure name in the Collect bucket](loading_data.md#bucket-layout)) for the workflow that will use the lookup
        |table_name |required   |The name of the DynamoDB table deployed by the InsuranceLake CDK stack for single value lookups, in the form `<environment>-<resource prefix>-etl-value-lookup`
        |data_file  |required   |Filename of the local JSON file containing lookup data to load into DynamoDB (format below)

    - Example usage:
        ```bash
        ./load_dynamodb_lookup_table.py SyntheticGeneralData dev-insurancelake-etl-value-lookup syntheticgeneral_lookup_data.json
        ```

    - JSON format of the lookup data file:
        ```json
        {
                "column_name1": { "lookup_value1": "lookedup_value1", "lookup_value2": "lookedup_value2", ... },
                "column_name2": { ... }
        }
        ```

### multilookup
Add columns looked up from an external table using multiple conditions, returning any number of attributes

|Parameter    |Type    |Description    |
|---	|---	|---	|
|lookup_group    |required   |Name of lookup set of data which is used to match the `lookup_group` attribute in the DynamoDB table; use to uniquely identify the set of lookup data
|match_columns    |required   |List of one or more columns specified as a JSON array to use for matching the lookup data; **the order of columns specified must match the order of the columns specified during the data load**
|return_attributes  |required   |Specifies the attribute names in the DynamoDB lookup table to add to the incoming dataset; defined as a JSON array and must contain at least one attribute
|nomatch  |optional   |Value to use for lookups that have no match, defaults to null. Used as the value for all `return_attributes` columns. **Must be the same data type as the looked up data.**

```json
"multilookup": [
    {
        "lookup_group": "LOBCoverage",
        "match_columns": [
            "program",
            "coverage"
        ],
        "return_attributes": [
            "coveragenormalized",
            "lob"
        ],
        "nomatch": "N/A"
    }
]
```

- The `match_columns` names only refer to the incoming dataset. The column names in your lookup data (in DynamoDB) do not matter, because all the lookup column values are stored in a concatenated string in the lookup_item sort key.

- **Important Note:** If a column already exists, a duplicate column will be created, which will raise an error when saving to Parquet format. Take care to map your incoming dataset correctly so that it has unique column names after performing the multilookup transform. For example, suppose your incoming data has a `lineofbusiness` column, but it is composed of bespoke values that you want to normalize. Best practice would be to use the schema map to rename `lineofbusiness` to `originallineofbusiness` so the incoming data is preserved, and use the multilookup to return a new (normalized) `lineofbusiness` attribute value.

- The provided `resources/load_dynamodb_multilookup_table.py` script can be used to load prepared CSV data into the DynamoDB table:

    - Script parameters:
        |Parameter  |Type   |Description    |
        |---    |---    |---    |
        |table_name |required   |The name of the DynamoDB table deployed by the InsuranceLake CDK stack for multi-lookups, in the form `<environment>-<resource prefix>-etl-multi-lookup`. All multilookup lookup datasets are stored in the same table and grouped by lookup_group.
        |data_file  |required   |Filename of the local CSV file containing lookup data to load into DynamoDB
        |lookup_group  |required   |Any meaningful name to uniquely identify the lookup data in the DynamoDB table
        |lookup_columns |required   |One ore more columns in the CSV file to use as lookup values, listed **last**, separated by spaces. Note that field values from each specified column will be concatenated with a hyphen (`-`) separator to form a lookup key that matches the `lookup_item` attribute in the DynamoDB table. This is important to understand when editing the data in the future.

    - Example usage:
        ```bash
        ./load_dynamodb_multilookup_table.py dev-insurancelake-etl-multi-lookup lookups.csv PolicyData-LOBCoverage originalprogram originalcoverage
        ```

    - The lookup data file should be saved as CSV and include all the match columns and return value columns. It is ok to have some columns that are not used, because the transform specification allows the user to select the specific return columns they want in each transform.

### filldown
Fill starting column value down the columns for all null values until the next non-null

|Parameter    |Type    |Description
|---	|---	|---
|field    |required    |Name of column on which to perform the filldown operation
|sort    |optional    |List of columns to use for sorting of the data before filling down, specified as a JSON array. This will change the order of the data for subsequent transforms. Defaults to no sort (data is left in the state from which it was loaded or from the last transform).

- This function is useful for replacing null values created by pivot tables in Excel that have category headers inline with only the first row of data. This will normalize the data ensuring that the headers are on all rows.

- This function works by partitioning the data over non-null values in the columns, so it is important that your rows of data are organized such that the non-null values indicate the values you want to fill in the subsequent rows of data. If your data is not already organized in this way, use the sort optional parameter.

- This is a Spark implementation of [Pandas ffill](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.ffill.html) based on the article [How to utilize nested tables and window functions to fill down over null values by Robert O'Brien](https://towardsdatascience.com/tips-and-tricks-how-to-fill-null-values-in-sql-4fccb249df6f)

```json
"filldown": [
    {
        "field": "category"
    },
    {
        "field": "subcategory",
        "sort": [ "timestamp" ]
    }
]
```

### filterrows
Filter out rows based on standard SQL WHERE statement

|Parameter    |Type    |Description
|---	|---	|---
|condition    |required    |String filter condition using [Spark WHERE clause syntax](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-ref-syntax-qry-select-where.html); **rows that match will remain in the data set**
|description    |optional    |This parameter will be ignored, but we recommend using it to document the purpose of each filter condition

- Use only when certain rows can be systematically and confidently discarded. Examples of usage include removing blank rows, removing a totals rows, or removing subtotal rows. If review of filtered data is desired, consider using [data quality quarantine rules](data_quality.md). An example of both options can be found in the [Corrupt Data section of the Loading Data with InsurnaceLake Documentation](loading_data.md#corrupt-data).

```json
"filterrows": [
    {
        "description": "Claim number or file number is required",
        "condition": "claim_number is not null or file_number is not null"
    },
    {
        "condition": "`startdate` >= cast('1970-01-01' as date)"
    }
]
```

### merge
Merge column values using coalesce 

|Parameter    |Type    |Description
|---	|---	|---
|field    |required    |Name of (destination) field to hold the result of merging/coalescing the source columns; can be the same field as one of the source columns, which will overwrite the original value
|source_list    |required    |List of source column names specified as a JSON array (at least 1 is required)
|default    |optional   |Specifies the literal value to use when all source columns have empty (null) values, defaults to null
|empty_string_is_null   |optional   |Specifies whether empty strings should be treated as null values, in other words, whether empty string values should be replaced; defaults to false

```json
"merge": [
    {
        "field": "insuredstatemerge",
        "source_list": [
            "insuredstatename", "insuredstatecode"
        ],
        "default": "Unknown",
        "empty_string_is_null": true
    }
]
```

### rownumber
Adds row number column to rows based on an optional partition column list, and optional sort column list. Use this transform to add row numbers, to index rows within categories, or to enumerate possible duplicate rows based on primary keys.

|Parameter    |Type    |Description
|---	|---	|---
|field    |required    |Name of (destination) field to hold the rownumber result; can be an existing field, which will overwrite the original value
|partition  |optional   |List of columns to partition over (look for changing values) specified as a JSON array; if not specified, the function will number every row of data in the set sequentially
|sort    |optional    |List of columns to use for sorting of the data before numbering, specified as a JSON array. This will change the order of the data for subsequent transforms. Defaults to no sort (data is left in the state from which it was loaded or from the last transform).

```json
"rownumber": [
    {
        "field": "row_number"
    },
    {
        "field": "policy_month_index",
        "partition": [ "policynumber" ],
        "sort": [ "start_date" ]
    }
]
```
